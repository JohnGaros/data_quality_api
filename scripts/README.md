# Utility Scripts

## Purpose
- Collects helper commands that speed up local setup, data seeding, and maintenance tasks.

## Typical scripts
- `run_local.sh`: start the API with common defaults.
- `seed_demo_data.py`: load demo tenants, rules, and sample files for testing.
- `migrate_db.py`: run database migrations or schema updates.

## Guidance for non-developers
- Check script headers for prerequisites (Python version, environment variables).
- Use these scripts in controlled environments first (sandbox or test).
- Coordinate with engineering before modifying or adding new scripts.
