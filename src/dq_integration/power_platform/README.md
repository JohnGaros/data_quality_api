# Power Platform Integration

## Purpose
- Provides connectors and exporters to plug the DQ API into Microsoft Power Platform tools.

## Components
- `powerapps_connector.py`: enables Power Apps interfaces to interact with the API.
- `powerbi_exporter.py`: prepares validation results for dashboards and reports.
- `msflow_hooks.py`: supports Power Automate (Flow) workflows and notifications.

## Notes for PMs
- Useful when customers expect low-code experiences or dashboard visualisations.
- Coordinate with business stakeholders to prioritise which connectors go live first.
