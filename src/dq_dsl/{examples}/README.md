# DSL Examples (Placeholder)

## Purpose
- Reserved for sample scripts that demonstrate how the future rule DSL might look.

## Current status
- Empty by design; examples will be added once the DSL stabilises.

## Guidance
- When prototypes are ready, include both the DSL snippet and the equivalent rule configuration so stakeholders can compare.
- Highlight business-friendly language to prove the value of the DSL approach.
