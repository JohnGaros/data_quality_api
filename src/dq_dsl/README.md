# dq_dsl Module

## Purpose
- Exploratory area for a future domain-specific language that lets non-developers write rules.
- Not part of the MVP, but groundwork exists for grammar and parsing experiments.

## Current assets
- `grammar.lark`: draft grammar definition.
- `parser.py` and `compiler.py`: prototypes for turning DSL statements into executable rules.
- `{examples}/`: placeholder for sample DSL scripts (to be expanded later).

## Guidance
- Treat this module as a research sandbox; changes here should not impact the main roadmap unless agreed.
- Document experiments clearly so future contributors can build on the effort.
