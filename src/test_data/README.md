# Test Data Samples

## Purpose
- Stores small, anonymised datasets used for demos, automated tests, and regression suites.

## Guidelines
- Keep files lightweight so they can be version-controlled.
- Document the scenario each sample represents (billing, payments, edge cases).
- Do not store real customer data; use synthetic or sanitized records only.

## Usage
- Reference these files when writing tests or showing stakeholders how validation works.
- Update metadata references when adding new samples so lineage remains accurate.
