# Update Profiling Validation Context

## Purpose

This document outlines the necessary updates to the project documentation to incorporate the new **Profiling-Driven Validation Architecture**. The goal is to ensure that all references to validation contexts reflect the profiling-driven approach, improving clarity and consistency across the codebase and related materials.

## Concept

The Profiling-Driven Validation Architecture introduces a paradigm where validation contexts are dynamically adjusted based on profiling data. This approach enhances validation accuracy and efficiency by tailoring validation rules and thresholds according to observed data patterns and statistics.

Key aspects include:

- Dynamic adjustment of validation rules based on profiling results.
- Integration of profiling metadata into validation context definitions.
- Improved feedback loops between profiling and validation processes.

## Editing Instructions

When updating project documents and code comments:

1. **Terminology**: Replace generic references to "validation context" with "profiling-driven validation context" where appropriate.

2. **Descriptions**: Add explanations that highlight the role of profiling data in shaping validation logic.

3. **Examples**: Update or add examples demonstrating how validation contexts adapt based on profiling insights.

4. **Code Comments**: Modify comments in code files to reflect the profiling-driven approach, emphasizing dynamic adjustment mechanisms.

5. **Diagrams and Flowcharts**: Where applicable, revise diagrams to illustrate the integration of profiling into validation workflows.

6. **Consistency**: Ensure that all mentions across documentation, READMEs, and inline comments consistently describe the profiling-driven validation context.

By following these guidelines, the project documentation will accurately represent the enhanced validation architecture, facilitating better understanding and maintenance.
