# Rule Templates Folder

## What lives here
- Example rule libraries and mapping templates used to validate customer data.
- Files are usually Excel or JSON so configuration teams can edit them without coding.

## Why it matters
- These templates drive the behaviour of the validation engine.
- Version control in this folder helps us track what changed, when, and by whom.

## How to use
- Create drafts in a sandbox branch.
- Coordinate approvals with the governance team before promoting changes to production.
- Link each file to the corresponding tenant and configuration version in the metadata layer.
