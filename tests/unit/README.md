# Unit Tests

## Purpose
- Check small pieces of code in isolation (functions, classes, helpers).

## What to expect
- Fast execution, ideal for local development.
- Mocked dependencies so failures point to the exact line of code.

## When to run
- After making code changes in `src/`.
- Before opening a pull request to catch issues early.
