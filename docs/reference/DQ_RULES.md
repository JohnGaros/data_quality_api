# Theoretic Data Quality Rules

## Categories of Data Quality Rules

1. Attribute domain constraints (e.g., past-due balance cannot be negative)
2. Relational integrity rules (e.g., account keys in ledger dataset must exist in account dataset)
3. Rules for historical data (e.g., missing billing records)
4. Rules for state-dependent objects (e.g., terminated accounts must not receive new invoices, accounts outside perimeter definition, etc.)
5. General dependency rules (e.g., balance reconciliation)
